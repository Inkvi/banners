banners
=======

The main goal of application is to show banners randomly, based on their weight. 
A lot of things are simplified. For instance, SQLite is used for easy setup. 

The application has banners and user management capabilities. 
`demo` user with `demo` password is created by default. Some admin action can be done only under `demo` user.

The easiest way to deploy this application is to used built-in web server in PHP 5.4:
`php -S localhost:8081 -t /path/to/application/directory/`
